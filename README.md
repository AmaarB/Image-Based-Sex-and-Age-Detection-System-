# Image Based Sex and Age Detection System

The Age and Sex Predictor project uses deep learning to infer a person's age and sexÂ from pictures. The model is built upon an EfficientNet architecture that has already been trained and optimised for image recognition tasks. The CelebA dataset, which contains photos labelled with characteristics like gender and age, is the source of the dataset used for training and testing.
